Project 2 - Working with flex styling an hotel reservation responsive website

# Main interest
The focus of the project was to use flex and media query to make the website responsive across all devices
I was given a mock-up, so the project was pretty straight forward.
I had to choice for the tablet version and the the filter section animation

# Structure
This was my first project so the css is a little bit messy. But i took the time to make table of content
to help navigate through the different sections, using comments.
We have 1 css file for each of the break points: max 767px for phones, minimum 768px for tablets and beyond 991px for desktop.
Having 3 files helped with keeping the code readable / maintainable in a way.
